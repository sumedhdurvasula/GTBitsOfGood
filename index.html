            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Sumedh Durvasula, 
                and I am a 3rd-year Computer Science major. 
                My passion lies in volunteering and improving the community.</p>
        
            <p>From lending a hand at local organizations like Open Hand Atlanta and Meals by Grace, I've witnessed 
                the impact that an individual can have when having a sincere commitment to making a difference.</p>
        
            <p>I was born and raised in the great city of Atlanta, Georgia, where I am dedicated to enhancing the 
                community.</p>
